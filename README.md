### Design

##### １　Framework Design

- SpringBoot with embedded SpringMVC/Spring/Tomcat
- H2 Database to store city information. The H2 is embedded exclusively within the Application and start/stop along with the System. 
- Alibaba Druid is JDBC Connection Tools. And it is integrated to the System to improve performance while connecting to DB.
- Instead of using JDBC directly to touch DB, the application is using MyBatis to improve development efficiency.
- The application is using Swagger to generate Restful Document.
- The application is designed as two parts. One is Java based back-end using DAO->Service->Controller Pattern. And the other part is front-end using JavaScript / Css/ Html. There are no dependency for the two parts. and the two parts is interact with each other by Restful services. and the transfer data format during each interaction is JSON.

##### 2　API Design

- Get Current Weather Info By City Code

  - URL:  /weatherinfo/{code}
  - Parameter:  code / String / City Code
  - Method: GET
  - In order to follow on the third-party Weather API. Currently City code and City name are both same. For instance, City name is Paris then City code is also Paris.
  - City can be created dynamically by invoking below Restful API.<br/>[/city/save] Create a City<br/>And it need to provide City Code and City Name parameter. and the method is [POST].

- All the available Restful APIs are generated by Swagger. You can use follow URL to check it on-line directly.<br/>http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui.html

### TODO
The following is to be continued.

- Junit Tests based on SpringBoot

- Application Build Script.  <br/>Currently you can download source code from GitHub and the using command [mvn spring-boot:run] to run the application.

- Docker file<br/>Make a docker image for the application and run it from a container.
